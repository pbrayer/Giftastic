# Giftastic

This is a simple page that integrates with Giphy's API. Click on any of the Pokemon buttons to generate 10 still Gif images (pulled from Giphy). 

User may also enter a custom string / pokemon into the form and hit submit(or enter) to add a new button.

Users will need to either hit a button or submit a custom string to get started.
